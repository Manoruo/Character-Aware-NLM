This project is a reimplementation of the “Character-Aware Neural Language Models” work of Kim et al. 
The goal is to learn about Character-Aware Neural Language Models and how one can use it to model language.


[Model Structure]

1. This language model leverages subword information through a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN)

2. The output of the CNN is used as an input to a recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM).
